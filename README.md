Projects and notes for _Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming_ (_Politecnico di Milano_, 2023-2024)

# Advanced algorithms and Parallel Programming
The _Advanced Algorithms_ challenge is an alignment problem to be solved with dynamic programming.<br>
The _Parallel Programming_ challenge concernes the parallelization with MPI of a given sequential code, which computes the coverage of of molecules expressed in the SMILES notation.

A full description of the challenges and their solution can be found in the challenge folders.
